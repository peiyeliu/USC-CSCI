CERTIFY IT'S YOUR WORK

"I certify that the work submitted for this assignment does not
violate USC's student conduct code.  In particular, the work is my
own, not a collaboration, and does not involve code created by other
people, except for the the resources explicitly mentioned in the CS 455
Course Syllabus.  And I did not share my solution or parts of it with
other students in the course."

----------------------------------------------
ACKNOWLEDGE ANY OUTSIDE SOURCES

List here any code you submitted for this assignment that was written
with significant help of a course staff member, or code used from the
textbook.  Be specific about what methods or algorithms are involved,
and what sections of the textbook are involved (if applicable): [you do
not need to list any of the code that we wrote for the assignment,
i.e., the contents of the starter files for the assignment]

ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

Question 1:
The code allowed:
(1) the code written by the course staff
(2) the code from the textbook
(3) students are required the acknowledge the source in the README file, permission from the instructor might be
required

Question 2:
two heads: 0.25
one head, one tail: 0.50
two tails: 0.25

For each coin, the probability of head and tail are equal, 0.5 to 0.5.
two heads = first coin head and second coin head, probability = 0.5*0.5 = 0.25
two tails = first coin head and second coin tail, probability = 0.5*0.5 = 0.25
for the one head one tail result, there are two cases:
first coin head, second coin tail, probability = 0.5*0.5 = 0.25
first coin tail, second coin head, probability = 0.5*0.5 = 0.25
overall, the probability for one head one tail = 0.25 + 0.25 = 0.5

Question 3:
1500 trials is a fair value to give results within 1% derivation.

Question 4:
when the input value is 2000000000, 2047483647 ot 2097483647, the bar chart still showed up correctly within 5 minutes
the max value of Integer is 2147483647, when this value was typed, no output was shown after 1 hour, but there is not
overflow error shown.
